# Credit-EDA-Assignment
#**Description**
This repository contains the code and data for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application data to identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of loan default. The dataset provided includes information about loan applicants at the time of applying for the loan, with two types of scenarios: clients with payment difficulties and all other cases where payments are made on time.
#**Business Objectives**
The primary objective of this case study is to identify patterns and driving factors that indicate whether a client is likely to face difficulties in repaying their loan. By conducting EDA, we aim to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default. This understanding will help the consumer finance company in making informed decisions, such as:

Approving loans for applicants who are likely to repay on time.
Reducing loan amounts or charging higher interest rates for risky applicants.
Denying loans for applicants with a higher likelihood of default.
Ultimately, the goal is to mitigate financial losses for the company and ensure that deserving applicants are not rejected.
